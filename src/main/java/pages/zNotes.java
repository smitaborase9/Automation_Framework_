      AUTOMATION FRAMEWORD
             A framework is a combination of set protocols, rules, standards and guidelines that can be
             incorporated or followed to the benefits provided by the Framework.

     Advantage of Test Automation framework

Reusability of code
Maximum coverage
Recovery scenario
Low-cost maintenance
Minimal manual intervention
Easy Reporting

  Data Driven Testing Framework

While automating or testing any application, at times it may be required to test the same functionality multiple
  times with the different set of input data.
In such cases, we can’t let the test data embedded in the test script.
Hence it is advised to retain test data into some external database outside the test scripts.
Data Driven Testing Framework helps the user segregate the test script logic and the test data from each other.
It lets the user store the test data into an external database.
The external databases can be property files, xml files, excel files, text files, CSV files, ODBC repositories etc.
The data is conventionally stored in “Key-Value” pairs.
Thus, the key can be used to access and populate the data within the test scripts.
